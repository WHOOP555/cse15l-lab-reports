Code flows like a river,
On the banks of GitHub,
Where developers gather,
To share and collaborate.

Branches branching out,
Like the roots of a tree,
Each one a new idea,
A chance for innovation to be.

Commits like stones,
Marking progress along the way,
Building up the project,
Bit by bit, day by day.

Issues raised,
Problems to solve,
The community works together,
To evolve and evolve.

With GitHub as the hub,
We spin the wheel of progress,
Creating and improving,
In this digital wilderness.
