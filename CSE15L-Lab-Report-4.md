5. 
I pressed `<ctrl> + v` and then hit `<enter>`. I had `git clone git@github.com:WHOOP555/lab7.git` copied to my computer, so I pasted this and hit `<enter>` to clone my fork of the repository.

6. 
I pressed `<up><up><up><up><enter>` and then `<up><up><up><up><enter>` again to first compile the testers and then run the tester. The respective commands were 4 up in the search history, so hitting `<up>` 4 times for each command allowed me to access these commands through my terminal command history.

7. I typed in `nano ListExamples.java` so that I can edit ListExamples.java and fix it such that the testers pass. I then hit `<ctrl> + w` followed by `<ctrl> + t` and `43 <enter>`, which took me to line 43 in ListExamples.java, which is the exact spot where I needed to edit the file. I then pressed `<right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><right-arrow><backspace>2`, which took me to the "1" in "index1", after which I pressed backspace and 2 to change it into "index2". Lastly, I hit `<ctrl> + o`, then `<enter><ctrl> + x`, which let me save the changes to the file and exit out of the nano editor, ultimately resulting in fixing the bug in the file.

8. I then pressed `<up><up><enter>` to run the tester again. I only had to press up twice since the command was only 2 up in the search history.  This ran the tests again and showed that they now succeded.

9. I then typed `git add ListExamples.java` and hit `<enter>`, to update the changes to the file such that I can commit them to my repository. I then typed in `git commit -m "Fixed bugs in ListExamples.java"` and hit `<enter>` to commit the changes. Lastly, I pushed the changes to my fork of the repository by typing in `git push` and hitting `<enter>`.
