# CSE 15L Lab Report 1: Remote Access
---
1. ## Installing Visual Studio Code
    * The first step to logging into a course specific account on ieng6 is to install Visual Studio Code.
    * I already had Visual Studio Code installed on my device prior to this remote access lab, so I did not have to install it in this session.
    * If you do not have Visual Studio Code installed on your device, navigate to [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the version of Visual Studio Code that is compatible with your device and sufficient for your course.

2. ## Remotely Connecting
  * First, navigate to [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and discover what your course specific account and its username is. Then, reset your password, utilizing the aid of this tutorial: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit). Make sure to wait approximately 15 minutes after the password reset has finished to proceed, as the password register takes some time to register. Make sure you install git ([Link](https://gitforwindows.org/)) if you are using a windows device and set your default terminal to use git bash, as per this tutorial: [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994)
  * Next, open up a terminal in VSCode and type in the following command: `$ ssh cs15lwi23ddd@ieng6.ucsd.edu` with the "ddd" replaced by the letters at the end of your course specific account. If taking another course and/or during another quarter, make sure that you use your respective username instead of "cs15lwi23ddd". If a message prompts you to verify whether you do indeed want to continue to connect, affirm the request and then type your respective password.
  * You should now be connected and view some text like this in the terminal: <img width="467" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122576045/212815184-b873658b-b752-4a7f-a711-329b96391483.png">
